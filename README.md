# project1
# Official Name: Paperboy
# An alternative search engine for news - the goal was to capture results from both conservative and liberal sources with a touch of # modern sources such as YouTube and Reddit.

Project 1
Problem to solve: There’s too much clutter/overload when searching for information/news on Google and other search engines.
There are also various sources for news that people might individually use to find information that aren’t found in one place
Hypothesis: To develop a feature that gets relevant information that the user searches for from six different sources and to display the results in a neat, user-friendly way.
Integration of project requirements:
Use of multiple new APIs to pull information to display
NYT
Fox News
Repeating element: Cards nested in Columns (TBD)
CSS Framework: Bootstrap
User Input Validation: The user’s search input will be validated 
New Bootstrap Library Incorporated for additional features on top of vanilla bootstrap
Potential New Library:
http://animejs.com/

Non-requirement MVP 
    ✔ Upon click of bubble, open source in new tab7
Content summary in each bubble
Use anime.js to animate a loading bar after search is inserted to animate a loading bar for bubbles

Post-MVP Ideas:
Card Flips
Share Results with share button for social media
Search filters, 
Final Feature Attempt(after doing the other most-MVP ideas): Save favorite bubbles into a favorites list (potentially use Firebase but should be ~easily~ doable with LocalStorage).
Trivia Game Generator for like “Trivia of the day” feature
